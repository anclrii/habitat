Terraform and Ansible testing with AWS

## Objective
The objective is to design and deploy a Production ready web service in AWS with the following criteria:
* The web service must be highly available
* Be able to hit a sample web page from the web service deployed using HTTPS port 443 and redirected to port 8080
* For provisioning use Terraform and deployment tool use Ansible
* OS â€“ Ubuntu or Centos

## High Level Plan
* use Terraform to provision multiple Ubuntu EC2 instances
* use Ansible to configure a web server/application on these instances, listening on port 8080
* setup an AWS ALB listening on port 443 and balancing the traffic to the servers on port 8080

## Points to consider 
* Monitoring and maintainability
   * investigate using CloudWatch to monitor the service/servers
   * monitor from outside of AWS 
   * attempt to simulate customer experience
* Capacity and growth
   * provision more servers
   * investigate EC2 Auto Scaling 
   * using Beanstalk might be a simpler way to deploy a scalable web application
* Deploying to a Production environment that has VMs already running
   *  be cautious
   *  run any changes against a dev environment
   *  make good use of `plan` and `check` to make sure we know what terraform and ansible are doing
   *  ensure you have a rollback plan

## Rollout
### Terraform - provision the EC2 hosts
 *  [Terraform rollout notes](/TERRAFORM.md)
### Ansible - configure the web server and application
 *  [Ansible rollout notes](/ANSIBLE.md)
### ALB - configured manually
 *  [ALB rollout notes](/ALB.md)
## Results

load balancer on 443
   * https://balance1-1506060314.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/
   
individual webservers on 8080
   * http://ec2-52-56-201-248.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/
   * http://ec2-3-8-136-28.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/

## Prerequisites
note:  `revo` is the local host that I am driving the work from
* a public key (`mikey`) has been added via the AWS console
* terraform has been installed on `revo`
```
mike@revo:~$ terraform -v
Terraform v1.0.6
on linux_amd64
mike@revo:~$
```
* aws cli on `revo`
```
mike@revo:~$ aws --version
aws-cli/1.18.69 Python/3.8.10 Linux/5.4.0-84-generic botocore/1.16.19
mike@revo:~$
```
* aws cli configured for use
```
mike@revo:~$ cat ~/.aws/config
[default]
region = eu-west-2
output = json
mike@revo:~$ cat ~/.aws/credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <private>
aws_secret_access_key = <private>
mike@revo:~$
mike@revo:~$ aws iam list-users
{
    "Users": [
        {
            "Path": "/",
            "UserName": "mike",
            "UserId": "AIDA4BHSKKQS4M4SKZI5Y",
            "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::827289392165:user/mike",
            "CreateDate": "2021-09-11T12:16:49Z"
        }
    ]
}
mike@revo:~$
```

## Gotchas
* login to the Ubuntu instances with "ubuntu" used not "ec2-user"
* terraform was not able change the description of a security group
   * terraform was unable to remove the security group because it was in use
* ansible would not run against the `habitat` host group, but only worked when specifying the individual hosts
   * it seemed to not like the password for the ssh key when using the group, even though it was fine when run against the host
