Terraform and Ansible testing with AWS
## Objective
The objective is to design and deploy a Production ready web service in AWS with the following criteria:
* The web service must be highly available
* Be able to hit a sample web page from the web service deployed using HTTPS port 443 and redirected to port 8080
* For provisioning use Terraform and deployment tool use Ansible
* OS â€“ Ubuntu or Centos

## High Level Plan
* use Terraform to provision multiple hosts, either using multiple EC2 instances or Beanstalk (which may provide auto-scaling)
* Use ALB to load balance, configured either as part of Beanstalk, or separately with Terraform
* use Ansible to configure a web server/application on the instances provisioned by Terraform

## Points to consider (TBD)
* Monitoring and maintainability
* Capacity and growth
* Deploying to a Production environment that has VMs already running.

## Notes
* `revo` is the local host that I am driving the work from

## Prerequisites
* aws cli on `revo`
````
mike@revo:~$ aws --version
aws-cli/1.18.69 Python/3.8.10 Linux/5.4.0-84-generic botocore/1.16.19
mike@revo:~$
````
* terraform on `revo`
```
mike@revo:~$ terraform -v
Terraform v1.0.6
on linux_amd64
mike@revo:~$
